# One-time setup for the repository's release tag protection. Run by hand,
# once. Requires repo-admin `gh` auth.
#
# `linktogo` is a personal GitHub account, not an organization, so there is
# no Teams feature to gate on: tag creation is restricted to the
# repository's Admin role (which today only `linktogo` holds). Automated
# tagging (.github/workflows/prepare-release.yml) authenticates as that same
# account via the RELEASE_PAT repository secret, so it satisfies this
# restriction too — see "Tagging and publishing" in CONTRIBUTING.md.
#
# Publishing to npm (.github/workflows/publish.yml) has no equivalent gate:
# it runs unattended once a GitHub Release is published.
